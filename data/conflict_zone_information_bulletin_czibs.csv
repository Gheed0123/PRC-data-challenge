Considering the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, there is a high risk to civil aviation. The conflict involves rockets, missiles and drones launches from Lebanon with Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire, including systematic activation of air-defence systems.
 
Hezbollah’s possession of all-altitude capable cruise and ballistic missiles, along with the deployment of air assets operating at various altitudes, increases the risk of misidentification and miscalculation.
 
Additionally, cruise missiles and military-grade weaponised drones launched by Hezbollah allies create additional concerns for the safety of airspace in the region.
 
Although, until now the Civil Aviation Authority of the State of Israel has been efficiently managing the risks to civil aviation in its airspace through a tactical deconfliction, it is considered that the current intensity of the conflict represents an overall high risk to civil aviation.

","This CZIB is issued based on information currently available to EASA and the European Commission in order to share information which is considered necessary to ensure the safety of flights over zones of interest and indicate areas of high risk.
 
Considering the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel there is a high risk to civil aviation. The conflict involves rockets, missiles and drones launches from Lebanon and Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire.
 
Hezbollah’s possession of all-altitude capable air-defence systems, cruise and ballistic missiles, along with the deployment of air assets operating at various altitudes, increases the risk of misidentification and miscalculation.
 
The recent intensification of the conflict, with air strikes targeting southern Beirut and the North-East part of the Lebanese territory, marks a sharp escalation in the military activity that constitutes a threat to civil aviation.
 
In terms of airspace management, the State concerned has not demonstrated full capability to address existing airspace risks by implementing an efficient and proactive approach to the airspace deconfliction. As a result, there are limited mitigating factors, on which air operators can rely.
 
Considering the above and the current intensity of the conflict, it is considered that there is a high-risk in the entire airspace of Lebanon.

","South Sudan","Applies to operators",,"Following six years of civil war, a ceasefire is currently in place, and has largely held since February 2020. On 4 August 2022, parties to the peace deal agreed to extend it for another 24 months starting  in February 2023, when the original deal is expected to expire.Nevertheless, the security situation remains volatile and despite of the positive developments, there are continuous risks to flight operations safety deriving from possible use of small arms fire, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-aircraft fire, and shoulder-fired MANPADS (man-portable air-defence systems) owned by violent non state actors. Due to the ongoing situation it the region, the airspace is assessed to pose a HIGH risk to operations at altitudes below FL 250.

","This CZIB is issued based on information currently available to EU Member States and EU institutions. Due to the current volatile situation in Sudan caused by on-going  armed clashes between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the opposition Rapid Support Forces (RSF), there is a continued possible threat to civil aviation.The primary threat to civil aviation stems from military operations with the availability for use in the conflict of air assets, anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) systems, MANPADS and SAM systems. Aircraft on the ground are also at risk given military operations affecting airports. Based on the existing security situation, there is continuous risk to aviation due to potential misidentification, miscalculation or collateral damage by the parties engaged, when using anti-aircraft weaponry.The presence and possible use of a wide range of weapon systems poses a HIGH risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels. 
","In view of the existing risk posed by military activities with the use of air assets and air-defence capabilities of the parties engaged in the conflict, EASA recommends not to fly within the airspace over Sudan at all altitudes and flight levels. Air operators should closely monitor airspace developments in the region and follow all available aeronautical publications concerning the region issued by or on behalf of Sudan and by the Aviation Authorities of the neighbouring States, including information shared through the European Information Sharing and Cooperation Platform on Conflict Zones, alongside available guidance or direction from their national authorities.

","This CZIB is issued based on information currently available to EU Member States and EU institutions in order to share information which is considered necessary to ensure the safety of flights over zones of interest. 
 
Following the Hamas attack against Israeli civilians and military forces on 7 October 2023, a  conflict has broken out between Hamas-led Palestinian armed groups and Israel. The conflict involves rockets and drones launches from the Gaza Strip with Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire. Israel air-defence systems have been systematically activated and reportedly shot down the majority of the incoming projectiles.
 
Since 27 October 2023, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) gradually expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip.
 
Since the beginning of the conflict, rockets and weaponised drones have also been launched by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon at northern Israel, triggering IDF response strikes on Hezbollah positions inside the Lebanon South Governorate. While the armed clashes occurred close to the Israeli – Lebanese border, incidents in the areas over 40 km from both sides of the border were also observed.  
 
Cruise missiles and military-grade weaponised drones launched by the Houthis from Yemen towards south Israel create additional concerns for the safety of airspace in the region, affecting in particular the Red Sea and adjacent airspace over the neighbouring countries, including southern Jordan, western Saudi Arabia and eastern Egypt. 
 
The recent developments and the potential for escalation in armed clashes, affecting the safety of airspace in the region, are continuously monitored by EASA and the European Commission. 
 
The Civil Aviation Authority of the State of Israel is actively managing the risks to civil aviation in its airspace and at its main airports, by issuing and maintaining NOTAMs, and by providing tactical deconfliction. It is therefore considered that those risks are, for the time being, effectively managed and mitigated by the Israeli State authorities. Nevertheless, airspace users need to be aware of the complexity and possible rapid evolution of the current situation, and on-going rocket launches potentially affecting the safety of the airspace and of aircraft on the ground.
 
Due to the unstable situation, EASA will continue to closely monitor the situation, with a view to assess whether there is an increase or decrease of risks for EU aircraft operators as a result of the evolution of the threat.
 
Air operators are requested to report as soon as possible any observed incident affecting potentially safety of airspace through the EU civil aviation occurrence reporting mechanism so that  Competent Authorities would be in position to share this information with EASA and the Commission without delay.  
","Air operators should:

Take potential risks into account when operating in the affected airspace;   
Monitor airspace developments in the region and follow all available aeronautical publications, in particular airspace closures or restrictions issued by State authorities, alongside available guidance or direction from their national authorities, including information shared through the European Information Sharing and Cooperation Platform on Conflict Zones; 
Ensure that a robust risk assessment is in place together with a high level of contingency planning for their operations and be ready for short notice instructions from the State authorities.

","All altitudes / flight levels of the FIR ADDIS ABABA (HAAA) over the Tigray Region of northern Ethiopia. 
",Ethiopia,"Applies to operators","Air operators:
-    subject to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) 965/2012, planning to conduct operations in the affected airspace (EASA operators).
-    third Country Operators authorised by EASA, when conducting operations under their TCO authorisation to, from and within the EU (TCO operators).
 
","This CZIB is issued on the basis of information currently available to EU Member States and EU institutions. 
Due to the current volatile situation in the region caused by the on-going conflict between the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), there is a continued possible threat to civil aviation.
The primary threat to civil aviation stems from anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) systems, MANPADS and SAM systems being available in the region. On the basis of the existing tensions and until a comprehensive political and military agreement is reached, there is continuous risk to aviation due to potential misidentification or miscalculation by the parties engaged, when using anti-aircraft weaponry.
The presence and possible use of a wide range of weapon systems poses a HIGH risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.
 
Note: This Conflict Zones Information Bulletin (CZIB) is issued by EASA, acting in accordance with Art. 88 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139. 
","In view of the existing risk posed by air-defence capabilities in the region, EASA recommends not to fly within the airspace over Tigray Region in northern Ethiopia and to exercise caution when operating in the airspace of bordering regions.
Operators should take this information and any other relevant information into account in their own risk assessments, along with any available guidance or directions from their national authority, as appropriate.
